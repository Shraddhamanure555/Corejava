/*
 *1.today notes : 
 *	TypeCasting :
 *		two types - implicit and explicit 
 *	  implicit : is done the bydefult opration intrnally meas baani baniyi chiiz
 *	explicit: here the smaller bigger data is converted in  bigger data type 
 *	while we done the process to chance to loss the data
 *	
 *2.Operator :
 * Arithmetic (binary)
 * Relational / Comparison
 * Assignment (Unary)
 * Logical
 * Boolean
 *3.Ternary -here we adding the 3 variables 
 * 
 *Details: 
 *	Arithmetic: 
 *		+,-,*,/,%
 *		/  Division(Q)
 *		% modulus (remainder)
 *4.Relational /Comparison: it gives the output in boolean (true/false)
 * 	when the condition is satisfy then it print the true statement if not it return the false
 * 		==
 * 		>
 * 		>
 * 		<=
 * 		>=
 * 		!=
 * 5.Assignment operator:
 * 		where we assign the value 
 * 		perform the operation from the left to right 
 * 	=
 *	+=
 * 	-=
 * 	*=
 * 	/=
 * 	%=
 *	For example:
 *		a=9;
 *		a+=5; output = 14 .....perform the operation from the "left to right "
 *
